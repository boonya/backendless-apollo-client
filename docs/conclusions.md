# Conclusions

I tried to cover the most often cases in this presentation. But you may still find some more special. Like server side filtering, pagination, data refetching, polling and many others. In this time slot I can only say that I had experience with all of them and they are can be handled by this solution very well.

Also the solution may help you to cover by integration tests as many critical cases as you need.

## Outro

Apologize if this presentation was worded scrumpled. I hope we still have a time for questions. So if you have any, please got for it. I will do my best to give you a correct answer.
